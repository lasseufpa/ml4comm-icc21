# Installation of MimoRL-simple-1-v0 RL agent

The RL agent is executed at a base station (BS) with an antenna array and serves single-antenna users on downlink using an analog MIMO architecture with Nb beam vector indices. The BS and users live in a M x M grid world in which there are M2 invariant channels depending only on position. An episode lasts Ne time slots, and for each episode, a user moves left/right/up/down. It is an episodic (not continuing) task. The reward is the normalized throughput T and a penalyy of -100 is added to T if a user is not allocated for Na consecutive slots and zero otherwise


The state is defined as a vector with Nu elements for the usersâ€™ positions and Na-1 indices of the previously scheduled users.
The agent action is, at each time slot, to schedule one among Nu users and choose the beam index to serve this user.

# Installation of beam_selection notebook

In order to run the *beam_selection.ipynb* notebook, you need to download the input and output data for the neural network.
The files can be obtained at https://nextcloud.lasseufpa.org/s/mrzEiQXE83YE3kg
where you can find folders with the three distinct sets of input parameters: coord, image, lidar. You can use only one, all 3 or any combination.
You also need the correct output labels, which is the file beams_output.npz in the folder beam_output.
After downloading the datasets, save them in the folder specified in the notebook or change the code to point to your folder. The default folder name is data.

In case you intend to use all three sets of input parameters, you will end up with the files in the following folders:
* Contents of: your_folder\ml4comm-icc21\data
  *                                          beam_output
  *                                          coord_input
  *                                          image_input
  *                                          lidar_input
* Contents of: your_folder\ml4comm-icc21\data\beam_output
 *                                            45,850,920 beams_output.npz  
 *                                            45,850,920 beams_output_no_ori.npz (we will not use this one)
* Contents of: your_folder\ml4comm-icc21\data\coord_input
 *                                            179,380 coord_input.npz
* Contents of: your_folder\ml4comm-icc21\data\image_input
 *                                            43,522,538 img_input_20.npz
* Contents of: your_folder\ml4comm-icc21\data\lidar_input
 *                                            447,760,264 lidar_input.npz
